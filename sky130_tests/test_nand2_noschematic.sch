T {The symbol is expanded as a nand2 gate instantiating 4 mos transistors.
See the symbol format string to define unique mos names and 
unique internal nodes.
This implementation allows to pass as parameters also the spice models
of the transistors as expansion is done by xschem.
Model names can not be passed as .SUBCKT parameters in spice simulators.
Since nand2 is instantiated as an array of 4: x1[3:0]
16 transistors will be generated in netlist to form 4 independent
